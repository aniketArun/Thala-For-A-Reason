# Thala Webpage

![Thala Webpage](/Assets/thala.png)

This is a simple webpage that checks if the sum of digits entered by the user equals **7** or if the length of the entered string is **7**. If either condition is satisfied, a music clip is played and a message "You Got Thala" is displayed. Otherwise, it displays "You Not Got Thala".

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle user input, calculate the sum of digits, check the length, and play the music.

## Features

- The user enters a string containing characters and/or digits.
- If the sum of the digits equals **7** or the length of the string is **7**, a sound is played, and the message **"You Got Thala"** is displayed.
- If neither condition is met, the message **"You Not Got Thala"** is shown.
  
## How It Works

1. The user types a string in the input field.
2. The JavaScript function extracts digits from the string and calculates their sum.
3. It also checks the length of the entered string.
4. If either the sum of digits is **7** or the length of the string is **7**, a music file is played and the success message is displayed.
5. Otherwise, a failure message is shown.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enter any combination of characters or digits in the input field.
4. Enjoy the music if you get "Thala"!
